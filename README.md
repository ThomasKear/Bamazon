# Bamazon

When the customer starts Bamazon (by entering node bamazonCustomer.js) they are immediately presented with the list of available items in a table (CLI-table from npm). They are prompted to identify by the ID, which item they would like to purchase. There is a validation in place to ensure they enter a numeral.

After they made their choice, it confirms that there is enough product. It will let them know how many are in stock and how many they are ordering and give them the total monies due.

If there isn't enough product to satisfy the order, it will tell them there is "insufficient quantity" ask they adjust their order and lets them know how much is in stock.
